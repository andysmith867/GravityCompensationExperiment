Processing Code
Included in this repository is the source code and script used to process Trivanti EMG Sensor data along with joint angle data from the Exo - H3. The un processed data retrieved and used in my disertation can also be found in this file under the /Data folder. 

In order to run this code, please add "/Data" and "/Source" to your path. Then, in the "/Script" folder, please run the "script" file. 

In the "/Data" folder, the .mat files are data retieved from the Exo-H3 during the analytical, numerical and zerot torques methodology. The .txt file is the EMG data retrieved from the trivanti EMG sensors. Please note, there is EMG data for the analytical method. The reasoning for this is explained in my disertation.

Enjoy.
